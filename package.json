  Excellent course. Some of the packages in this file, however, are deprecated. I guess that's inevitable. Are you planning to keep it up to date?

  shinokada commented on Jul 31
  I hope this file will be updated. e.g. webpack is now v-2.

  I have installed dependencies manually, so they are up-to-date. I will test it if it works ok.
